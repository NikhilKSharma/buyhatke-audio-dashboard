DATA CLEANING NOTES — Buyhatke Audio Sales Project

1. Imported raw Excel data and checked for duplicates using “Remove Duplicates”.
2. Standardized columns — ensured correct data types:
   - Date → Date type
   - Price, Revenue → Numeric
   - Product/Brand → Text (Proper Case)
3. Removed rows with missing product IDs or user fields.
4. Created helper columns:
   - WeekNum → =WEEKNUM([@date],2)
   - Price_Band → =IF(Q2<1000,"Budget",IF(Q2<=3000,"Mid-Range","Premium"))
   - Refurbished_Flag → =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("refurbished",F2)),"Refurbished","New")
5. Made a lookup table for replacing all the brand names with their PROPER names.
5. Verified revenue totals and created “ANALYSIS_INPUT” sheet for Power BI import.
6. Final check for formatting issues and ensured consistent headers.
