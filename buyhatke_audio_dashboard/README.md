## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before building the dashboard, the raw dataset (`business_analyst_assignment_raw.xlsx`) was cleaned and standardized in Excel.  
Below is a summary of the major cleaning and transformation steps performed:

| Step | Description | Excel Features Used |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1️⃣ Removed Duplicates | Checked for duplicate transaction entries based on `user`, `product_id`, and `date`. | Data → Remove Duplicates |
| 2️⃣ Handled Missing Values | Filled missing prices using category averages and removed rows missing essential identifiers. | IFERROR, AVERAGEIF |
| 3️⃣ Standardized Formats | Converted date columns to proper date type, ensured consistent text casing for brand and product names. | Text Functions, Date Formatting |
| 4️⃣ Added Helper Columns | Created new fields like `WeekNum`, `Price Band`, and `Refurbished_Flag` for richer analysis. | WEEKNUM, IF, SEARCH |
| 5️⃣ Created Clean Sheet | Generated a final sheet `ANALYSIS_INPUT` containing verified, structured data for Power BI import. | Copy → Paste Values |

Each transformation step ensured that the dataset was free of inconsistencies, redundant rows, and incorrect formats.  
These cleaning steps directly improved the quality and reliability of all downstream analysis and visualizations.

📁 The cleaned and raw data files are available in the `/data_preparation/` folder for reference.
